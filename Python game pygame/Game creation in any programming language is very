Game creation in any programming language is very rewarding, and also makes for a great teaching tool. With game development, you often have quite a bit of logic, mathematics, physics, artificial intelligence, and other things, all of which come together for game creation. Not only this, but the topic is games, so it can be very fun.

Many times people like to visualize the programs they are creating, as it can help people to learn programming logic quickly. Games are fantastic for this, as your are specifically programming everything you see.
